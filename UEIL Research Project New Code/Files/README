To run: after setting up the paths accordingly (not using addpaths), run the CavitationSimulationTest file, which mainly references the SingleCavitationSimulation class.
Currently, this will run the base-case simulation for only one microbubble.
When the CavitationSimulation class is completed (general case, rather than only 1 microbubble), CavitationSimulationTest will be updated accordingly...
